# ML Metacognition Upgrade (Phase 3)

Mathematical optimization of AI self-reflection using convexity proofs.

## Features

- Feedback integration loop
- Convexity proof via sympy
- Gap reduction (10-iteration convergence)
- 2nd derivative optimization

## Philosophy

Enables the AI to reflect on its own performance and improve iteratively.
