# AFO_OFFICIAL_WORKFLOW_V1 (SSOT)

## Purpose
We run in two lanes:
1) Free Talk Lane (exploration)
2) Seal Lane (official, reproducible, evidence-backed)

## Lane 1: Free Talk
- Any format allowed.
- Goal: discover, brainstorm, propose.
- Output can be messy.

## Lane 2: Seal (Official)
When you say: "봉인", "오피셜", "명령서", "리포트", "VERIFY"
We must produce:
- ORDER (ops): docs/ops/** (what to do)
- REPORT (ops): reports/** (what happened)
- EVIDENCE (SSOT): 6-line block required in every report

## Non-negotiables
- Evidence block must be generated by scripts/afo_report_evidence_v1.sh
- Evidence contract is SSOT: docs/ssot/AFO_REPORT_EVIDENCE_CONTRACT_V1.md
- Ops docs stay in docs/ops/, protocols stay in docs/ssot/
