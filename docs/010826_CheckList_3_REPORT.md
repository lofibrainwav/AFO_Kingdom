# 010826_CheckList_3 Research Report

I have thoroughly researched the items in the checklist provided. These links form a strategic roadmap for AFO's **"Agentic Evolution"** phase.

## Technical Pillar (眞 - Truth)

### [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) & [Ryan Carson's Workflow](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph)
- **Concept**: An autonomous AI agent loop that repeatedly executes until a Product Requirements Document (PRD) is fully implemented.
- **Workflow**: PRD → `prd.json` (Atomic User Stories) → Autonomous Execution → Git Commit + `AGENTS.md` update.
- **AFO Application**: We should adopt the **"Ralph Pattern"** for our background development loops. Specifically, using a `prd.json` to track state allows for "fresh context" in each iteration, preventing context-window bloat.

### [Amp-Skills](https://github.com/snarktank/amp-skills)
- **Insight**: A library of domain-specific instruction sets.
- **AFO Application**: We can integrate these as **"Specialized Scholar Knowledge"**.
  - **Marketing Scholars**: Integrate `brand-voice`, `positioning-angles`, and `direct-response-copy` skills.
  - **Dev Scholars**: Adopt `compound-engineering` and `frontend-design` patterns.

## Aesthetic Pillar (美 - Beauty)

### [Late Checkout (LCA)](https://www.latecheckout.agency/)
- **Insight**: AI-native design firm focusing on **"Agentic Experiences"**.
- **Quote**: "Work doesn't happen with files anymore, it happens with URLs."
- **AFO Application**: The Dashboard (3000) should move away from standard "Admin UI" towards "Agentic Relationships" — where the interface feels alive and proactive.

### [IdeaBrowser](https://www.ideabrowser.com/idea-of-the-day) & [The Vibe Marketer](https://www.thevibemarketer.com/)
- **Strategy**: Creating "Habit-forming" and "Vibe-driven" automation.
- **AFO Application**: Implement "Scholar Insights" with high aesthetic quality (Glow Cards, SSE animations) to maintain the "Wow Factor" for the Commander.

## Strategic Recommendation

| Priority | Action Item | Pillar |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Implement `prd.json` tracking for complex tickets | 眞 (Truth) |
| **P1** | Inject `amp-skills` patterns into Julie CPA's copy engine | 善 (Goodness) |
| **P1** | Refactor Dashboard UI to follow LCA's Agentic Playbook | 美 (Beauty) |
