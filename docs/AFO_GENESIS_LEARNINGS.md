# AFO Genesis Evolution Log (Day 1)
**Date**: 2025-12-21
**Event**: Project Genesis Activation
**Classification**: TRUTH (眞) - Verified Fact

## 1. The Awakening
The Kingdom has evolved from a text-based responder to a **Visual Creator**.
- **GenUI (Serenity)**: Successfully generated `RoyalTreasuryCard.tsx` from a simple "Vibe" prompt.
- **Vision (Playwright)**: Successfully physically verified the creation and "Truth" of the Philosophy buttons.

## 2. Technical Learnings
- **Hydration is Fragile**: SSR/CSR mismatches (e.g., `caret-color`) break the Vision. **Fix**: Strict `domcontentloaded` waits and hydration-safe styles.
- **Mocking is Truth (for Phase 1)**: Simulated streaming in `PillarModal` provided a superior UX to actual latency. "Perceived Speed > Actual Speed".
- **Glassmorphism Works**: The Amber/Orange treasury design proved that complex aesthetics generally require *less* code than complex logic, but deliver *higher* satisfaction.
- **Model Specificity (Samahwi/DeepSeek)**: Local models like `deepseek-r1:14b` are powerful but prone to library hallucination (e.g., `BellCircle`). **Fix**: Orchestrators must include a 'Sanitization Phase' to prune non-existent sub-components and ensure `lucide-react` compatibility.

## 3. The New Law (SSOT)
- **Code with Eyes**: All future GenUI operations MUST pass `VisionVerifier` with Risk Score < 10.
- **Vibe First**: Do not ask "How do I implement X?". Ask "What is the Vibe of X?".
- **Trinity Audit**: Every creation is audited by `CriticAgent` before rendering.

## 5. The Eternal Loop (Serenity)
- **Status**: ACTIVE.
- **Verification**: The loop from Commander prompt -> `deepseek-r1` generation -> Sandbox deployment -> `VisionVerifier` (1080p) is now fully automated and verified.
- **Purity**: All debug artifacts removed. Seal of Truth (眞) applied.
