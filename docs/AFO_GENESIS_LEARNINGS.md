# AFO Genesis Evolution Log (Day 1)
**Date**: 2025-12-21
**Event**: Project Genesis Activation
**Classification**: TRUTH (眞) - Verified Fact

## 1. The Awakening
The Kingdom has evolved from a text-based responder to a **Visual Creator**.
- **GenUI (Serenity)**: Successfully generated `RoyalTreasuryCard.tsx` from a simple "Vibe" prompt.
- **Vision (Playwright)**: Successfully physically verified the creation and "Truth" of the Philosophy buttons.

## 2. Technical Learnings
- **Hydration is Fragile**: SSR/CSR mismatches (e.g., `caret-color`) break the Vision. **Fix**: Strict `domcontentloaded` waits and hydration-safe styles.
- **Mocking is Truth (for Phase 1)**: Simulated streaming in `PillarModal` provided a superior UX to actual latency. "Perceived Speed > Actual Speed".
- **Glassmorphism Works**: The Amber/Orange treasury design proved that complex aesthetics generally require *less* code than complex logic, but deliver *higher* satisfaction.

## 3. The New Law (SSOT)
- **Code with Eyes**: All future GenUI operations MUST pass `VisionVerifier` with Risk Score < 10.
- **Vibe First**: Do not ask "How do I implement X?". Ask "What is the Vibe of X?".
- **Trinity Audit**: Every creation is audited by `CriticAgent` before rendering.

## 4. Expansion Vectors (Gwanggaeto)
- The "Treasury" is currently static. It must breathe with `Julie CPA` data.
- The "Silence" is a friction. The dashboard must "Sound" like a kingdom.
