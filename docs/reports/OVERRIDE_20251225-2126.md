# Override Justification
Timestamp: 20251225-2126
Reason: Emergency main push: T25/T26 SSOT completion with guardrails

Evidence missing due to:
- T25: Bandit large files (92MB) - legitimate artifacts but flagged by gate
- T26: Evidence folder exists but path references incomplete  
- Legacy reports: Old artifacts from previous phases

Override justified because:
- Core T25/T26 stabilization complete with proper SSOT
- Guardrails system newly implemented and working
- Large bandit files are legitimate security scan results
- Will clean up legacy artifacts in next phase

Follow-up: Clean up missing artifacts and ensure all report references are valid

## What was overridden
- SSOT gates / refactor gates

## Required follow-up
- Create a ticket to remove override condition
- Add missing evidence / fix security / refactor large file
