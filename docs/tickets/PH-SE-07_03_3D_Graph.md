# PH-SE-07-03: 3D Graph (InfraNodus) Strategy

## 🎯 Objective
Achieve **Spatial Awareness** of the Knowledge Base using 3D visualization.

## 🧩 Component Analysis
- **3D Graph (New)**: A high-performance 3D graph renderer for Obsidian.
- **InfraNodus**: Network analysis tool to find "Structural Gaps" (what are we missing?).

## 🛠️ Implementation Specs (Kingdom Standard)
### 1. 3D Graph Settings
- **Z-Axis**: Map `created_date` or `phase` to the Z-axis to see the "Evolution" of the Kingdom over time.
- **Clusters**: Force-directed 3D clusters for `packages/afo-core` vs `docs`.

### 2. InfraNodus Insight
- Use for **Periodic Audits** (Weekly).
- "Where is the disconnected knowledge?"
- Output: Actionable list of "Orphaned Nodes" to be linked in `PH_SE-06` density passes.

## 📅 Execution Plan
1.  Provision `3d-graph` settings.
2.  Create a "Weekly Graph Audit" checklist in `docs/operations/`.
