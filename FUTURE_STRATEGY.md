# AFO Kingdom: Future Strategy (永 - Eternity)

## 1. Philosophical Vision (2025-2026)

The AFO Kingdom transitions from a "Reactive Assistant" to a "Declarative Self-Improving Sovereign System." The core objective is **Absolute Sovereignty** through total local optimization and self-healing intelligence.

## 2. Identified Strategic Gaps

| Area | Current Problem | Strategic Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Observability** | Silent failure in OTel/Sentry deps | **Low Truth (眞)**: System is blind to internal anomalies. |
| **Rag Maturity** | Skeleton ChainOfThought only | **Low Goodness (善)**: Retrieval is not yet "Active" or corrective. |
| **Multimodal** | Fragmented router support | **Low Beauty (美)**: UX lacks visual/audio cognitive depth. |
| **Process Control** | Fragile shell-based management | **Low Serenity (孝)**: High friction during deployment/resurrection. |

## 3. 2025 Evolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Agentic RAG Ascension (Active Intelligence)

- **Self-Reflective RAG**: Implement iterative retrieval loops where the agent grades its own retrieved context.
- **Obsidion Shadow Deep-Link**: Fully automate the extraction of "Kingdom Wisdom" from the Obsidian vault.
- **DSPy MIPROv2 Hardening**: Transition from 200 threshold to "Semantic Density" triggers (Optimize when new *concepts* are encountered).

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Committee Orchestration

- **The Three Strategists (Trinity OS)**:
  - **제갈량 (Zhuge Liang)**: DSPy Optimization & Tech Architecture.
  - **사마의 (Sima Yi)**: Security Guardrails & Rate-Limiting.
  - **주유 (Zhou Yu)**: GenUI & Emotional Feedback.
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Use LangGraph for task delegation between specialized SLMs (Small Language Models).

### Phase 3: Multimodal Sovereignty (The Kingdom Sees & Hears)

- **Local Vision (Qwen2-VL)**: Integrate via Ollama for real-time dashboard visual analysis.
- **Audio Stream Audit**: Voice-reactive commands for the Soul Engine.

## 4. Immediate Concrete Actions (SCALED & COMPLETED)

1. [x] **Implement `scripts/md_clinical_clean.py` into CI/CD**: Integrated into `start_kingdom.sh`.
2. [x] **Repair Observability Pipeline**: Hardened in `api_server.py`.
3. [x] **Flesh out `RagActiveAgent.forward()`**: Live retrievers (GraphRAG/Obsidian) are now active.
4. [x] **Deploy Trinity Specialist Framework**: Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, and Zhou Yu are online.
